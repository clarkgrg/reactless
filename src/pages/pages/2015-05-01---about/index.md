#About 

I'm a developer - project manager - product manager turned back to developer.  I was working on a project that had a very slow development velocity and knew that there was a much simpler, quicker, and better way to write systems using the Cloud.

I started by creating a DevOps and distributed logging platform using Python/Flask and Amazon Simple Queue Service.  It worked so well which greatly lowered our support burden. It was so fun to add functions in the cloud, I was hooked. 

So the next obvious question was can the entire system I'm currently working on be ported to the cloud?  The answer to this question has fueled my love for serverless architectures, React, and React Native.

You can find me writing about React, React Native, and Serverless either from my house or from Smokey Row.
