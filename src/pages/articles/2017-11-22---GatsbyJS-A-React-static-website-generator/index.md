# Gatsby - That Blazing-fast static generator for React

It's pretty hard to start a blog on React and Serverless if I use a standard blogging platform like Wordpress.  I think it would be intellectually dishonest to talk about serverless and have a server based blog.  I could have written a blogging platform myself in React and serverless, but there is only so much time in the day and I had other things that I find more interesting.  

Therefore, I downloaded and starting working with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).  One of the great parts about the open source movement is there are lots of other people trying to do the same thing.  In fact I downloaded a starter pack for Gatsby that focused on blogging.  That starter pack is named [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen).  I encourage you to check it out.

It's only day 1 so I need more time to give a proper evaluation.  One of the most interesting aspects of Gatsby is its use of GraphQL.  If you were like me and wondered what GraphQL was and how to use it, you'll get a great lesson in Gatsby.  The tutorial in Gatsby has 4 lessons.  It's a pretty quick read.  The first tutorials gets your comfortable with the basics of Gatsby.  The fourth tutorial shows how to use GraphQL.  This tutorial alone is reason enough to take a look at Gatsby.
